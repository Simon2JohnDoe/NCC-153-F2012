          <h1>Washington's Birthday</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Washington's Birthday</strong> is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the third Monday of February in honor of George Washington, the first President of the United States, who was born on February 22, 1732. The Uniform Monday Holiday Act of 1971 moved this holiday to the third Monday, which can fall from February 15 to 21, inclusive. </p>

            <p>
              Colloquially, the day is also now widely known as <Strong>Presidents' Day</Strong> (though the placement of the apostrophe, if any, varies) and is often an occasion to remember all the presidents.
            </p>
            <p>
              The day is a state holiday in most states, with official names including <strong>Washington's Birthday</strong>, <strong>Presidents' Day</strong>, <strong>President's Day</strong>, and <strong>Washington's and Lincoln's Birthday</strong>. The various states use 14 different names. Depending upon the specific law, the state holiday may officially celebrate Washington alone, Washington and Lincoln, or some other combination of U.S. presidents (such as Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who was born in April).
          </p>

          <h2>Observation and traditions</h2>
          <p>Until the late 1980s, corporate businesses generally closed on this day, similar to present corporate practices on Memorial Day or Christmas Day. However, after having been moved to the third Monday, most businesses remain open with many offering sales and other promotions. Federal and state government services close (U.S. Postal Service, state Departments of Motor Vehicles, federal and state courts). Class schedules at universities and colleges vary depending on the school. Public elementary and secondary schools are generally closed, but some school districts, such as New York City, may close for an entire week as a "mid-winter recess".</p>
